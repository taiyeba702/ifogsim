Simulation of IoT system using ifogsim. This Smart Apartment simulation includes 3-tier hierarchy of Cloud, Fog and Edge devices. 
To evaluate the performance, Latency, Execution Cost, Execution Time, Network usage are compared of every tier.
Eventually execution at edge layer should provide most efficient performance of all.
